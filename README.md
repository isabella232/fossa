# Fossa

Backbone powered model interface to MongoDB, thin wrapper around MongoJS. The
MongoDB to Backbone relationship is upstream. Meaning the collection
can be updated by performing database reads, write/update/delete however must be
done explicitly.

Fossa provides first class database and collection control. This great power
comes with responsibilities though. The developer should manage database switches,
seperation of concerns and data integrity. In return Fossa will provide an easy
interface for interaction with the objects in MongoDB.
